            <p>I created this website to contain some of my previous artworks and act as my portfolio. 
            Using online resources, I had been teaching myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript and this was the first time that I made something of this scale using what I had learned. 
            The process of making this website allowed me to learn more about web design and web development. 
            It also drove me to find solutions to problems within my code that I had never run into before. 
            In the future, I would like to continue to improve my coding abilities, so that I can create better and more complex websites for future projects.

                <p>I made this video game as my final project for one of my college courses about game making and it was the first video game that I have ever made of this size. 
                    My intention for this project was to create a game that anyone of any age could play and enjoy, similar to other nostalgic video games that I grew up playing with my friends and family. 
                    Creating this game was my first experience making a game using Unity and C#, and throughout the process I had to learn a lot about both, in order to realize my vision. 
                    I have always loved video games and gaming in general, so creating this game has inspired me to continue to pursue game making.

                <p>I made this piece as my final project for one of my college courses about interactive media and it was my second time making an artwork using text-based code. 
                    The idea for this piece was inspired by kaleidoscopic imagery, as well as wanting to create something visually stimulating that also had optional interactive elements. 
                    I wanted the user to be mesmerized by the flowing shapes and colours, as they move around and blend into one another. 
                    While making this project, I learned more about coding using P5.js and interactive artworks. 
                    In the future, I'd like to continue to pursue creating interactive media using code, so this experience was very helpful in showing me the possibilities of what I might be able to do.

                I have always liked the idea of generative and randomized artworks, because I find it interesting to look at an artwork knowing that it will have a different result every time someone sees it. 
                I wanted the user to be captivated by the shapes and colours constantly in motion and merging together as they connect. 
                Throughout the process of making this piece, I learned a lot more about the capabilities of Max and got ideas of other things that I could use the software to create in the future.
